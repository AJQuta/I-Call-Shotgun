# I-Call-Shotgun

## Description
Mobile App that provides a way to have fun on roadtrips. Similar to Jackbox in concept. Keeps track of statistics: how long someone has had shotgun, efficacy of someone’s use of shotgun, who has had aux the longest, who’s playlist was considered the best overall, which song was the crowd favorite. Has fun ways for riders to determine who gets shotgun (challenges/”minigames”). 

Ex) App prompts each rider with a task secret to the other riders. Something like count the number of times Rider A says the word “drive” or secretly take a picture of Rider B. After a set time limit, the app lets everyone know who had what task and then players can grade or simply react to how everyone did (open to discussion).
